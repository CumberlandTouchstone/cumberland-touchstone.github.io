**Chasing Down the Calmest Places on Campus**

Many people on campus seek out the quietest places on campus to do work or just simply to relax for a second. Sometimes these places can be hard to find, as we find one nice place we enjoy and then it becomes a habit to go to that one place and you never venture out from there. 

With that in mind, I have found some special places to find a calm feeling that deserve a second look.

To begin with, there are always many classrooms open and empty on campus. The classroom schedule is almost always posted outside the door to that room, this way you can see what times and for how long what classrooms will be unoccupied. This opportunity can be taken to result in a quiet or relaxing classroom all to yourself, or a convenient place to work on a group project. This is a perfect place to study and work on things.

There are many small places throughout the campus that provide a small cubby hole of peace. These are found inside all of the buildings on campus. Usually at the end of the hall, the small places present a place to rest away from most foot traffic.

Walking into the LCC from the parking lot, you are greeted by a brightly lit building with vending machines and a small coffee bar. Down the first hallway, immediately to your right is room 125\. It is a dimly lit room with a setting that brings ease. Complete with a table, recliners, a nice desk, a microwave and a mini fridge, you can do homework, relax, take a nap, eat lunch and other things in this room.

Coming out of this hallway, to your left you have tables that are well lit. Personally, I like to sit and work or eat lunch here if it is too cold or rainy outside. Directly across from these tables are more tables, still in the light but a little less bright. There are also couches across from TVs. These are perfect for relaxing with friends. Upstairs in this building offers a nice loft area with a sofa and four desktop computers.

Coming out of this building onto the campus sidewalks, you will notice quiet areas against the walls on either side that both provide tables and chairs. I wholeheartedly recommend these areas, especially the area on the left hand side. 

Up the sidewalk to Labry Hall are more areas to relax. Walking into this building, you have the option to go upstairs, downstairs, to the side or straight down the hall that ends with a table and chairs. Wandering out of this first hallway, to the right in front of the business office, there are two sofa chairs and a table. With its bright window illuminating the space, I do love hanging out there. 

Just around the corner, you can go downstairs in Labry Hall. There are tables, chairs, vending machines, microwave, TV and a sofa making it a lovely place to spend time with friends, or study. This room is open to the above space of the 2nd floor of the building. On the left most of the space is a warm little corner with tables, chairs, a sofa and a large window to let in tons of natural light. I love to study here, eat lunch, or just hang out. On this same floor, continuing to the right is an area of many computers, desks, and even printers. Farther to the right are more tables lit up by the windows above. Entering the doors, in a cozy corner there are comfy chairs, a bench, and a bookcase. 

The basement of this building can be accessed by stairs or elevator and provides a space with a table that is almost always quiet and empty. I donâ€™t tend to visit it much because it offers no natural light. 

Out of Labry Hall, to the right of the building, walking past Memorial Hall and looking between the library is a large gazebo. I adore spending time there. Behind it is a beautiful assembly of lines called a labyrinth, representing wholeness. I love to walk it. Beside it is a wonderful area with two swinging benches, two tables, and three hammocks. I love this area so much\!

To the right is Vise Library, a very quiet building dedicated to keeping a quiet and organized place to study and concentrate. As typical libraries do, it is filled with many books and tables. You can even ask a friendly librarian to reserve a room for you to be alone, or with a group for 3 whole hours.

No matter your vibe, Cumberland University offers a place for you to feel calm and collected to reach any goal you have\!
